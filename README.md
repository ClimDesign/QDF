## Overview
Design values estimate the relationship between a flood’s return level (magnitude) and return period (frequency). Flood-duration-frequency (QDF) models are a class of statistical models that provide design value estimates at mulitple durations by simulateneously estimating several durations and quantiles at once under consistency constraints. They are are analgous to intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) models used in precipitation modeling.
